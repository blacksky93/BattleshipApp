This is my Battleship App that I built during my C# Master course. I'm writing code based on the requirements from Tim Corey, and I've added a few extra requirements as well. 

Here is my requirement gathering list:

Walk Through It

Welcome User to Battleship App
Ask player 1 to enter name
Show Grid with Available spots (A1,A2,B1,B2,etc.)
Player 1 = ask to pick spots 
Ask player to choose spots, print on screen each spot, keep looping until all spots are taken.
Clear Console

Ask player 2 to enter name
Show Grid with Available spots (A1,A2,B1,B2,etc.)
Ask player to choose spots, print on screen each spot, keep looping until all spots are taken
Clear Console

Player 1 starts
Player 1 sees player 2 5x5 grid
Player 1 types in spot
	If missed, say miss.
	If hit, say hit
Player 2 starts
Player 2 sees player 1 5x5 grid
Player 2 types in spot
	If missed, say miss.
	If hit, say hit.

After each player's first turn, their opposing Team grid shows which spot they selected, and show X or O based on if they hit or miss respectively. 
Continue until round 25, or if one of the players hits all five ships.
Announce the winner's name and player number
Show both grids, print out placement of losing and winning team. Show & for ships on winning player, and O and X on whether they hit or miss.
Thank you for playing
Play again?
